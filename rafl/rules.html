            <section>
                <strong>IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Liking a post DOES NOT enter you into the giveaway or give you bonus entries!</li>
                    <li>Each giveaway will have a cut-off date and time (likely 1-2 business days before the winner is announced). Any entries after the cut-off time won’t be added to the giveaway. Don’t worry, we’ll post and let you know what the cut-off day and time is!</li>
                    <li>Most gift cards in each giveaway are in-store only. In some cases, there may be gift card that can be used online, but most of the gift cards will not support online usage. Be sure you live in the area so you can use all the gift cards if you win!</li>
                    <li>Rafl is new. And like many new things, sometimes we may have to work some kinks out to make it better and better for you. If at any time you have a question, suggestion, or complaint, please emails us at info@raflgiveaways.com!</li> 
                </ul>
